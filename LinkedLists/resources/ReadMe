**Project Description**

This project is to be used as a guide to understand linked structures and pointers work. 

It is seperated into a bunch of different classes to explain the different operations
that can be done on both Single Linked Lists and Double Linked Lists.

A description of the following classes are outlined below -

1. SingleLinkedListNode.java

This is the data structure that represents a node in a Single Linked List. The node only
contains a single pointer to it's successor and only contains a single data field (Name).

It contains getter methods to retrieve the data fields and also the pointers to its successor.

2. SearchingSingleLinkedLists.java

This class details the implementation of searching for an item in a Single Linked List. It 
covers the search performed both iteratively and recurisively.
